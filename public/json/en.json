        "texto1": "Equitation is the art of riding a horse, a specialty within equestrian sports in which both the rider and the horse are evaluated. But the truth is that, although they are the protagonists, aspects such as clothing or the cleaning and polishing of the horse are other factors of great importance. In horseback riding, the rider must demonstrate his skills and abilities in controlling the horse, maintaining balance with the animal, showing the correct posture in each movement and displaying a dominant and relaxed attitude at the same time, directing the horse with total ease and determination.",
        "texto2": "The relationship between the horse and the rider is based on three principles: trust of the horse in the rider, leadership of the rider and optimal communication between them. These principles allow the horse to display the gaits or types of gait such as starting, stopping, walking, trotting, galloping and galloping.",
